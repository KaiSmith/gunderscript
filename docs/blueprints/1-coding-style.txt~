GunderScript Coding Style
********************************************************************************
For this project, all programmers are expected to maintain a strict coding style

 - All native code will be written in the C89 standard.
 - Code files may only contain code relevant to the function of the particular
   object of that file. e.g.: the ll.c file may only have functions pertaining 
   to the lexie linked list.
 - All function names must be lowercase words separated by underscores. Function
   names must begin with the name of the specific C file, unless the function is
   a static function, not declared in the header file. e.g.: int ll_new()
 - All variable declarations must be done in camel case. e.g. int newVariable;
 - All functions require comments before the function declaration, as well as
   inside the function before every loop or significant section of code. Every
   3 to 7 lines is a good general rule.
 - All comments use all lowercase and end with a period.
 - All function, while, if, etc. must have the open bracket '{' on the same line
   as the declaration. e.g.: if(is_true()) { ...
 - All C files should begin with a comment formatted similar to the one in 
   0-copyright-comment.txt
