This directory contains any **hopefully** up to date documentation regarding
Gunderscript. As always, check the code before assuming the DOCS are correct;
it is well commented.

If you are interested in seeing the original planning documents, look through
the commit history. Pseudocode.org was removed because it is out of date.
