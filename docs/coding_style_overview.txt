   For this project, all programmers are expected to maintain a strict coding style

   - All native code will be written in the C89 standard.

   - Code files may only contain code relevant to the function of the particular
     object of that file. e.g.: the ll.c file may only have functions pertaining 
     to the linked list.

   - All function names must be lowercase words separated by underscores. Function
     names must begin with the name of the specific C file or the feature provided
     by the C file, unless the function is a static function, not declared in the
     header file. e.g.: int ll_new()

   - All variable declarations must be done in camel case. e.g. int newVariable;

   - All functions require comments before the function declaration, as well as
     inside the function before every loop or significant section of code. 
     Comments should based upon pseudo code. Code will be constructed by copying 
     the pseudo code into the code file and creating comments with it, and then
     constructing relevant code and functions according to the comments.

   - All comments end with a period.

   - All function, while, if, etc. must have the open bracket '{' on the same line
     as the declaration. 
     : if(is_true()) { ...

   - All C files should begin with a comment formatted similar to the one in 
     the Copyright Comment Header Section in this file.

   - If, while, function declarations, etc. must not have a space between the 
     function/feature name and the open parenthesis. e.g.: if(true

   - There should be a space between every close parenthesis and open bracket.

   - All C files must contain the copyright comment header and be fully commented.
